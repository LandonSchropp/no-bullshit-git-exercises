# No Bullshit Git Exercises

These are the exercises for [No Bullshit Git](https://nobullshitgit.com), the practical, no-BS
course that takes you beyond the basics of Git.

## Downloading the Repo

The best way to download the exercises is to fork this repo. This is necessary because some of the
exercises involve changing the remote repo, and if everyone changed this copy, there'd be no repo
left.

First, if you're not already there, navigate to the
[no-bullshit-git-exercises repo](https://github.com/LandonSchropp/no-bullshit-git-exercises). Then
hit the `Fork` button in the upper right corner of your screen.

Once your repo is forked, clone *your* to your local machine and change into that directory.

```
git clone git@github.com:<your-github-username>/no-bullshit-git-exercises.git
cd no-bullshit-git-exercises
```

That's it! You're ready to exercise.
